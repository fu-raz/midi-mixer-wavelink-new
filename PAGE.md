# WaveLink MIDI Mixer Plugin for 1.6+

This plugin was created as a proof of concept for the new WaveLink 1.6 software. Elgato made a lot of changes to how their client works. I first started using MIDI Mixer with the WaveXLR plugin from Anais Betts (https://github.com/anaisbetts/midi-mixer-wavexlr). When the new version of WaveLink dropped, their plugin stopped working. I couldn't get the new version to work with their code, so I had to start over.

This is by no means a plugin that I'm going to support, but it does sort of work.
